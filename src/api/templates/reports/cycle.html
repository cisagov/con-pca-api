                This report provides the results for the CISA National
                Cybersecurity Assessments and Technical Services -
                (Vulnerability Management) led Continuous Phishing Campaign
                Assessment (CON-PCA) for {{ customer.name }}. The CON-PCA is a
                practical exercise intended to support and measure the
                effectiveness of security awareness training for information
                system users. The results of this CON-PCA show the
                susceptibility of {{ customer.identifier }} personnel to social
                engineering attacks—specifically email phishing attacks—in which
                an adversary tricks an email user into clicking a malicious link
                to gain unauthorized network access. In the scenario that this
                CON-PCA tested, the phishing attack bypassed technical controls
                that would normally detect and/or block malicious emails and
                links. The CON-PCA, therefore, measured {{ customer.name }}’s
                level of vulnerability to a successful phishing attack by
                targeted user click rates, click times, response rates, and
                response times, as shown in the "Targeted User Measurements"
                table.

                This report aims to enhance {{ customer.name }}'s understanding
                of their information system users’ cybersecurity behavior and to
                promote a more secure and resilient workforce.

              Vulnerability Management has provided this CON-PCA to {{
              customer.name }} at no cost and coordinated all
              activities—including planning and testing–with {{ customer.name
              }}'s point of contact. {{ customer.name }} maintained control over
              the testing, including providing target email addresses, approving
              phishing email templates, approving testing timeframes, and
              adjusting mail security setting to ensure inbox access. This
              CON-PCA was not intended to, and did not, test technical controls
              or electronic protections designed to block phishing attempts.
              This CON-PCA spanned a six-week period and aimed to capture
              behavior-based metrics of {{ customer.name }} information system

            <p>
              One of the most common measures of an organization’s
              susceptibility to phishing attacks is targeted-user click rates.
              If an actual phishing attack is able to bypass technical controls
              and arrive in a user’s inbox, the human target must click on the
              malicious link or attachment for the attack to be successful. In
              practical exercises, such as this PCA, targeted-user click rates
              will fluctuate depending on the level of email deception used in
              testing. Effective security awareness training, however, should
              result in a noticeable click rate decrease over time and to a
              level deemed acceptable based on the organization’s risk
              management posture.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this report, the percentages shown by the user click rate
              represent the percentage of targeted people who have clicked at
              least once on a “malicious” link. The number of unique clicks
              correlates to the number of end user devices potentially
              compromised in each campaign. The following table and graph
              summarizes click rates.

              of the factors designed to entice users to click on a malicious
              link. An explanation of the four factors used when determining an
              email’s level of deception can be found in "Deception Calculator”.
              The following defines key differences between each level:

              <p>
                <b>Level 1 - </b>This level will be the easiest to detect and
                features common scams that are easily identified. Templates will
                usually include low deception indicators such as bad grammar,
                fake domains, and unknown external senders. Commonly the emails
                will appeal to emotions of greed, monetary gain, or guilt to
                elicit a user’s response.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Level 2 - </b>These email templates also use low deception
                indicators in that they typically appear to be from an external,
                unauthoritative sender. The templates use one higher deception
                indicator such as decent or proper grammar and are written in a
                tone of urgency to help the email appear genuine. They also
                commonly appeal to emotions of greed, monetary gain, or guilt.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Level 3 -</b>These are email scams that usually use two
                higher deception indicators such as appearing to be from a
                legitimate external organization or spoofing a known internal
                office or job title, but the link is usually fake and not
                associated with the content. Templates typically will include
                low deception indicators such as bad grammar or display fake
                domains. The theme of the templates can appeal to emotions or
                guilt and cause a sense of urgency if the request is not
                followed quickly.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Level 4 -</b>The email templates use more high deception
                indicators than low deception and frequently appear to come from
                a commonly found internal department, such as “IT Support” or
                “Human Resources”. The templates will request actions or
                information that real world departments would be trained not to
                ask users over email such as their passwords, private
                information, or financial accounts. The email templates will
                normally have decent grammar, but will be sent by a generic
                account internal with fake domains. The template can appeal to
                sense of urgency and fear of disciplinary action to elicit a
                user’s click.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Level 5 -</b>This level includes seemingly common emails that
                might be sent from the respective organization and uses
                information gathered from publicly available sources to seem
                genuine. The templates usually come from internal and
                authoritative senders (high deception indicators) but with fake
                domains or generic information (lower deception indicators). The
                templates can appeal to a sense of fear and the need to comply
                with authority to elicit a user’s response.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Level 6 -</b> This level’s templates will be the hardest to
                detect and will typically have the highest click rate. These
                templates can appear to be from an internal office, personally
                address the recipient, and include themes such as negative
                policy changes and responses to internal and external news that
                may negatively affect employees. This level uses information
                gathered from public sources to develop the templates such as
                names of organizational individuals or departments, any relevant
                news, or information about specific organizational processes or
                tools.

              {% if template.template.deception_score <= 1 %} These poorly
              worded or purposefully vague messages are self-filtering. If
              someone is curious, greedy, or gullible enough to believe the
              sender then they are more likely to follow through with the

              messages attempt to short circuit common sense security training

              credentials to later gain access to sensitive business networks
              since people tend to reuse credentials over several platforms.
              Typical phishing techniques include spoofing a sending address to
              look like a legitimate group, individually addressing the
              recipient, and having a display name and signature of group
              typically seen in the workplace. {% elif

              deception, these messages typically target specific organizations

              is to have a recipient to download a malicious program on their
              workstation to give the attacker access to the internal network.
              Typical advanced phishing techniques include using all hidden or
              spoofed links that require the extra step of hovering over (or
              long pressing on mobile) to show the underlying URL and spoofing
              or mimicking the target organization’s email domain or signature

              personally addressing the recipient, spoofing or mimicking the
              organization’s email domain or signature block, referencing
              relevant real world events or data, and writing in a tone that

              In addition to training on the red flags and sophisticated
              techniques information system users were most susceptible to, CISA

              common phishing techniques and scams used to elicit clicks from
              target users in real world phishing incidents. A phishing

              <p>
                <b>A fake link. </b>The context of the email can be anything,
                but the key technique is using a link that looks like a real URL
                (or hyperlinked text) that the target has used and trusted
                before. Underlying it, however, is the actual URL to a different
                and potentially malicious site. Hovering over (when on a
                computer) or a long press (when on a mobile) reveals the true
                underlying link. Unexpected URLs should not be clicked. Even if
                it matches expectations, the user should type it directly into
                their browser.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>A fake website. </b>Hovering over or long pressing the
                displayed link will reveal a matching URL. However, closer
                inspection of the URL would reveal slight differences between
                the displayed address and real address it’s imitating. Examples
                of slight differences include replacing a lower case ‘l’ with a
                ‘1’, adding extra letters, or changing the domain such as from
                .com to .us. A few seconds’ pause to override autopilot clicking
                could save a target from being phished.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>A malicious attachment. </b>Just like the fake website,
                closer inspection of any attachments sent may reveal
                discrepancies between what is there versus what is expected.
                Questions that should be asked with each email attachment
                include: Was it an expected email? Is the sender known? Does
                their email address match their display name? Does the
                attachment have the expected file type? If a target does open
                the attachment, a document may then show a notice that “editing
                must be enabled to see content.” If enabled, macros and other
                malicious code are able to execute on the target’s computer.
                Organizations should have procedures for ensuring suspicious
                attachments are safe through use of file checkers or other
                secure means.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Fake contact information. </b>This technique is usually used
                to circumvent online portals or other established procedures
                that normally handle change requests. They provide the target
                with an email or phone numbers out of “generous convenience” so
                the target doesn’t have to spend time looking up that
                information. Rather than believing the email, the person should
                call the number provided to them previously such as the customer
                service number on the back of their card, office phone number in
                a directory, or on the organization’s site the person navigates
                to separately.

              <p>
                <b>Asking for money. </b>Usually long-winded stories of woe or
                sudden inheritance that only require a small sum of money on
                target’s part to transfer a huge sum of funds and generally in
                exchange for the “help,” the attacker promises to provide the
                target a decent portion of the funds. This scheme is designed to
                be outlandish because it’s self-filtering. Attackers know only
                the most trusting or gullible people will fall for this scam.
                This is intentional because the target is less likely to
                question further requests as the scam continues.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Business Email Compromise (CEO Fraud). </b>This scam has cost
                organizations nearly $26 billion since coming on the scene in
                2013 according to FBI reports. A company’s email infrastructure
                is hacked or spoofed and someone pretending to be the CEO tells
                their phishing target that they need help doing an urgent wire
                transfer. Sometimes the target is threatened with job loss or
                public shaming if they don’t comply. Setting and following
                established protocols that require a verbal phone call to
                confirm the transfer or having an additional person to submit
                the request are two ways to block this type of scam from
                succeeding.

                <b>Business Email Compromise (Vender Product Invoice). </b>
                Similar to the CEO fraud scam, a supplier’s email has been
                hacked or spoofed and the attacker uses it to send a company a
                fraudulent invoice. Having clear processes in place to confirm
                vendor change requests or invoice processing is one way of
                stopping this scam from working.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Stolen/Leaked psswords and extortion. </b>The information
                used to craft these emails come from the hundreds of millions of
                exposed online records. The attackers display a paired email and
                password saying their possession of these credentials is “proof”
                that the attacker has already hacked the victim’s computer. In
                exchange for not sharing some type of incriminating,
                embarrassing, or scandalous content with the target’s email
                contacts, the attacker asks for a bribe—usually in the form of
                crypto currency. Even though the hacking claims are false, this
                type of extortion is a quickly rising scam because people are
                too embarrassed to report it.

                <b>Security incident alert with offer to help. </b>This scam
                uses the fake contact information or fake website techniques in
                their plot to first get the target to panic and then trust the
                attacker as the quickest solution to their problem.
