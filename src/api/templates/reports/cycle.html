      <h1>3.1 Click Rate vs. Report Rate</h1>
      <p>
        One of the most common measures of an organization’s susceptibility to
        phishing attacks is targeted-user click rates. If an actual phishing
        attack is able to bypass technical controls and arrive in a user’s
        inbox, the 7A displayed link of type “Hidden” means hyperlinked text was
        used instead of a bare “Written Out” URL. A displayed link type of
        “Spoofed” means a fake URL or filename was used that would not match the
        “Hover Over” URL or file information. A displayed link type of “Written
        Out” always matches the “Hover Over” URL. human target must click on the
        malicious link or attachment for the attack to be successful. In
        practical exer- cises, such as this PCA, targeted-user click rates will
        fluctuate depending on the level of email deception used in testing.
        Effective security awareness training, however, should result in a
        noticeable click rate decrease over time and to a level deemed
        acceptable based on the organization’s risk management posture. The
        counterpart to user click rates is the user-reporting rate, determined
        by the number of emails sent or calls to alert SCONE’s helpdesk during
        each campaign. CISA recommends that organizations initially aim to have
        two people reporting the phishing attempts for every person that clicks.
        This ratio ensures that there is not only reporting coverage for the
        person clicking, but also redundant coverage in case the person who
        clicks the link does not report or does not realize they have been
        phished. Effective security awareness training should result in a
        noticeable report rate increase over time and to a level deemed
        acceptable based on the organization’s risk management posture. In this
        report, the percentages shown by the user click rate and user report
        rate represent, respectively, the percentage of targeted people
        (determined by a unique email address) who have clicked at least once on
        a “malicious” link and those who reported a suspicious email. The number
        of unique clicks correlates to the number of end user devices
        potentially compromised in each campaign. The number of user reports
        correlates to the number of opportunities the SCONE security team had to
        identify a potential breach and reduce its im- pact. Table 4 and figure
        1 summarize click and report rates.
