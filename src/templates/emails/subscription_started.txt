Dear {{ first_name }} {{ last_name }},



Thank you for participating in the CISA Phishing This
email is to inform you that your campaign has begun
starting {{ start_date|localtime }} UTC and will run
until {{ end_date|localtime }} UTC.

To assist you in differentianting between DHS Con-PCA
phishing exercise emails and actual phishing attempts
please use the following:

    All emails coming from the Con-PCA program will
    have a custom header:

    DHS-PHISH:{{cycle_uuid}}}

    Please look for this header. The value for the
    header is unique to your subscription and changes
    each cycle.

    The whois guard for all Con-PCA domains is turned
    off. Doing a whois lookup on the actual sender
    domain will show the domain owner as DHS.

    You will be sent an email containing all the
    templates used for your subscription. Review the
    provided templates to see if the suspected phish
    is one of the templates selected for your service
    cycle.

In the interests of security and efficiency, please
respond to your DHS contact directly with any
questions or concerns you may have

Respectfully,

CISA Continuous Phishing Program Adminstrator
