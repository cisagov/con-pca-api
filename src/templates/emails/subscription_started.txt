Dear {{ first_name }} {{ last_name }},

Thank you for participating in the CISA Phishing This
email is to inform you that your campaign has begun

until {{ end_date|localtime }} UTC.

The following template subjects will be used over the
duration of this cycle.

{% for template in templates %}
    {{template.subject}}
{% endfor %}

To assist you in differentiating between DHS Con-PCA
phishing exercise emails and actual phishing attempts
please use the following:

    All phishing emails from the Con-PCA program will
    come from the following domain:

    {{phishing_domain}}

    This will be the sending domain for the current
    cycle, but different display names will be used
    based upon the email template. This sending domain
    may change between cycles.

    All emails coming from the Con-PCA program will
    have a custom header:

    CISA-PHISH:{{cycle_uuid}}}

    Please look for this header. The value for the
    header is unique to your subscription and changes
    each cycle.

    You have enrolled {{email_count}} Emails in this campaign.

In the interests of security and efficiency, please

questions or concerns you may have

Respectfully,

CISA Continuous Phishing Program Adminstrator
