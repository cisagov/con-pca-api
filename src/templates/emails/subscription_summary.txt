    but different display names will be used based upon
    the email template. This email address may change between
    cycles.

    All emails coming from the Con-PCA program will
    have a custom headers:

    DHS-PHISH:{{cycle_uuid}}}

    header is unique to your subscription and changes
    each cycle.

    The whois guard for all Con-PCA domains is turned
    off. Doing a whois lookup on the actual sender
    domain will show the domain owner as DHS.

questions or concerns you may have

Respectfully,
